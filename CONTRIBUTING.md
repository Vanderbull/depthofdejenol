# Contributing to Black Lands: Depth of Dejenol

First off, thank you for considering contributing! 

## C++ Build & Development Guide

This project uses qmake for build configuration and Bear to generate the compilation database required for LSP-based editors (like Micro, VS Code, or Neovim).
## 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the necessary build tools installed on your system (Debian/Ubuntu):
Bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential qt6-base-dev bear

## 2. Initial Setup & Compilation

To build the project for the first time, follow these steps:

    Generate the Makefile:
    Bash

qmake6 project.pro

Build and Generate LSP Metadata: We use bear to intercept the build process and create compile_commands.json. This enables "IntelliSense" features (Autocomplete, Go-to-Definition) in your editor.
Bash

    bear -- make

## 3. Development Workflow
Adding New Files

If you add new .cpp or .h files to the .pro file, you must refresh the build scripts:
Bash

qmake6 project.pro
make clean
bear -- make

Daily Compiling

If you are only editing existing files, you can simply run:
Bash

make

Note: You only need to run bear again if you want to update the autocompletion database after adding new libraries or files.
## 4. Editor Integration (LSP)

This project is optimized for editors using clangd.

    Micro: Ensure the lsp plugin is installed. The compile_commands.json generated by Bear will be detected automatically.

    VS Code: Install the clangd extension. It will read the JSON file to provide accurate code analysis.

    Neovim: Use nvim-lspconfig with the clangd server.

## 5. Cleaning the Project

To remove all compiled objects and the metadata:
Bash

make clean
rm compile_commands.json

    Note for Contributors: Please do not commit compile_commands.json or Makefile to the repository. These are machine-specific files.

# Prerequisites

    C++20 Compiler (gcc or clang)

    Qt 6.x Framework

    Bear (Optional, required for generating LSP metadata/autocomplete)

Install on Debian 13:
Bash

sudo apt install build-essential qt6-base-dev bear

---

## Development Environment Setup
To get a fully working environment with autocomplete:
1. Install **Qt6**, **make**, and **Bear**.
2. Run `qmake6 project.pro`.
3. Run `make lsp` to generate the `compile_commands.json`.

## Code Style
Please run `make format` (or use clang-format) before submitting a PR.

## Old installation stuff

1. **Only Qt 6 is supported.**
2. Install all Qt 6 packages (e.g., `qt6-base`, `qt6-multimedia`, etc.).
3. Use `qmake6` to generate Makefiles.
4. Run `make` to build the project.
5. Execute with `./game_menu`.
