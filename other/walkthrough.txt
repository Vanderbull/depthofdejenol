|                               Background Story                             |
o============================================================================o

Following the War of The Races, the land of Mordor, shrouded in darkness for
hundreds of years, started to thrive and attract settlers and adventurers from
far and wide.  Trading posts became towns and towns flourished into cities.
Today there are hundreds of cities in the land of Mordor. The largest of these
cities is Marlith, which was built on the ruins of the ancient city of Rohin,
known to historians as “Dejenol”, which translates to “City of the Mines”. It
was at this location that vast Mines of Dejenol were built - over fifteen
hundred years ago by the Dwarven inhabitants of Rohin. These Mines were created
for the extraction of precious metals, including Platinum, Adamantite, Mithril,
and Gold, as well as necessities like Iron and Copper.

The facts surrounding the sealing of the Mines and the fall of Rohin are
shrouded in mystery, but are believed to be mostly accurate. Legends have it
that Rohin was the most powerful and wealthy city in all of ancient Mordor,
owing most of its wealth to the minerals and ores taken from the Mines. As the
metals were depleted on the upper levels, the miners dug deeper to find new
sources. Over a period of centuries, the Mines became so deep that it could
take several days to descend and work in the lower levels. As best as can be
determined, somewhere on a lower level, a floor gave way. It was from this
location that foul creatures began to appear, killing everything in sight.

As word reached the city of this catastrophe, search parties were organized
using only the best and most skilled miners. The few survivors recovered from
the lower levels had glazed and terrified looks and referred to the Mines
simply as “The Doorway to Hell”. From that time on, most of the search parties
that entered the Mines were never seen again. Those who did return told stories
of creatures and happenings that were so mystical and magical as to be nearly
unbelievable. 

In a matter of days, strange events were occurring closer and closer to the
entrance of the Mines and the city. It was then, that a decision to close the
Mines was made and a massive door was fashioned from a combination of ElvenOak
and Adamantite, the only combination believed strong enough to entomb the
creatures and the magic of the Mines. Once the Mines were sealed, a lack of
work and commerce caused the population of Dejenol to dwindle. It was during
this period that an evil wizard accompanied by an band of thieves blew the door
from its mounts and stole it for the valuable Adamantite.

The Wizard and his thieves were caught and the remains of the door returned,
but the damage had been done. Creatures had escaped from the Mines and built up
their numbers, hiding in the forests near the city. The city elders decided to
punish the thieves and their master by locking them inside the Mines. This time
the door was sealed with magic so strong that no-one would be able to open it
without the secret knowledge of the spell used to seal it.

It was after the Mines were once again magically sealed that a great battle
began between the inhabitants of Dejenol and the creatures that had escaped.
Due to the lack of warriors in Dejenol, a summons was sent out to all of the
lands. From this calling, the most skilled warriors and magicians came from all
over Mordor and from foreign regions as well.  Many of the creatures from the
Mines were not susceptible to normal combat. The battles for Dejenol lasted 2
years, during which the city was destroyed, the entrance to the Mines lost, and
most of the inhabitants were killed or driven mad. A few strong souls did
survive and lore has it that they guarded the entrance to the Mines until they
died, spending their final days recording what they knew, thought they knew, or
had heard about the Mines and the creatures within. Those who have entered and
returned speak of vast treasures, magical items, and unexplainable occurrences.

Over a thousand years passed before the entrance to the Mines was once again
discovered. With this discovery, the elders of Marlith began making
preparations to open the Mines and explore its depths. Scholars studied the
manuscript remnants found near the Mines’ entrance to glean what knowledge they
could about the Mines from the ancient scribblings. Equipped with this
knowledge, a limited number of explorers were permitted inside the Mines. At
first, many who ventured into the Mines were killed instantly, despite being
well equipped with the best weapons and magical skill. However, as the
explorers’ experiences of fighting, magic, and their knowledge of the Mines
increased, so did their chances of survival. With exploration came newer
knowledge, and with this new knowledge came a healthy respect for the long-lost
Dwarves, who created this vast underground world, and for the creatures that
still dominated the dark Mines. In the past year, more explorers have ventured
into the Mines than ever, eradicating the creatures they’ve encountered, and
forcing the nastier monsters deeper into the darkness.

It was around this time that a rumor began about a Prince of Devils, who was
said to exist in the deepest depths of the mines. At first, many believed the
creature to be a myth, used purely to instill fear into would-be explorers.
Yet, those with magical powers who have astrally scanned the mines swear that
they sense the presence of a dark, evil, and powerful being.

Even though nothing more is known about this Prince of Devils, the guilds have
decided to add the destruction of the dark being to their list of goals - and
for those who accomplish this task, they will receive the greatest gift of all
- Eternal life in the pages of history.

And now, having nearly run out of experienced explorers, a decision was made to
train new adventurers to survive in the Mines, hence the city elders formed The
Guilds. The Guilds train “students” in the skills and arts that are essential
to surviving and prospering in the Mines. It is now up to these new Guild
members to explore and return with information about the mines, which have
taken on a new name to those who dare enter...

The Depths of Dejenol.

Racial experience controls how much experience is needed to make a level.  A
human, with a 3 in exp, will level much faster than other races.

______________________________________________________________________________
---------------------------------------------------------------- Human (2.1) -

Humans are somthing you, as the player, can relate to.  They have no natural
resistances, but are the most versatile of all races and are allowed in every
guild.  They have the shortest life span, but are the quickest learners.


______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------ Elf (2.2) -

Elves are the magic users of the game.  Tall and slender, most Elves become
either Mages, Sorcerers, Healers, or Wizards. They are excellent spell casters
and can live longer than any other race.  They are not, however, very good at
fighting with weapons and have a low constitution.  elves also have a natural
resistance to Magical and Mind attacks.  Because of their lack of physical
strength, there are some items (which require great strength) that elves can
never use.


______________________________________________________________________________
---------------------------------------------------------------- Giant (2.3) -

Giants live for one thing - slicing a monster in two with one blow.  Know for
their brutal ways and having the advantage of being over eight feet tall, they
make the best Warriors on can find.  The only guilds to accept them are the
Nomad, Seeker, and Warrior guilds.  Because of their size and bulk, Giants are
resistant to most forms of attack, including Fire, Cold, and Electrical. 
Poison and Disease don't seriously affect them either.


______________________________________________________________________________
---------------------------------------------------------------- Gnome (2.4) -

Being very charismatic and possessing a slight resistance to Mind attacks,
Gnomes make excellent Mages.  Mostly good by nature, Gnomes are usually found
in the Mage, Healer, and Paladin guilds.


______________________________________________________________________________
---------------------------------------------------------------- Dwarf (2.5) -

Dwarves are very curious, always poking at chests, injured characters, and
carcasses.  Neutral in nature and stockier than most races, Dwarves are found
in quite a number of guilds, ranging from Warriors to Wizards.  They are also
fairly resistant to the elements (fire, cold, etc.).


______________________________________________________________________________
----------------------------------------------------------------- Ogre (2.6) -

Somewhat dim-witted, Ogres are bulky and hairy, and make good Warriors and
Scavengers.  Since their constitution and resistances to such elements as Fire
and Cold are so high, they are very hard to kill, but their low intelligence is
quite often their downfall.


______________________________________________________________________________
-------------------------------------------------------------- Morloch (2.7) -

Morlochs are huge masses of walking fur and muscle.  Possessing a great deal of
natural magic, they make excellent magic-users.  However, because they are so
ugly, they cannot easily charm some monsters, and their life span is almost as
short as a humans.  They also have a pretty good resistance to certain forms of
monster attacks (e.g. poison, disease).


______________________________________________________________________________
---------------------------------------------------------------- Osiri (2.8) -

Osiris, which are distant relatives of the elves that have shifted to a more
human-like race, are extremely dexterous and are mostly found in the Thief and
Scavenger guilds.  They also make marginal spell casters and are almost
completely resistant to Electrical and Mind attacks.


______________________________________________________________________________
---------------------------------------------------------------- Troll (2.9) -

A cross between an Ogre and an Elf, Trolls are strong and swift creatures that
possess a few natural resistances.  Making excellent Ninjas and Scavengers,
they are quick to take up sides (either Good or Evil), but can sometimes be
found as Neutral.  Due to the aggressiveness in relation to their alignment,
many guilds will not allow them.

Guild experience controls how much experience is earned from killing a monster.
A Nomad will gain 2x as much experience for killing a footpad as a Warrior.

______________________________________________________________________________
---------------------------------------------------------------- Nomad (3.1) -

Nomads are very quick learners, even though they do not try to learn many
different abilities.  Being good fighters and moderate thieves, Nomads are
often found roaming the upper levels of the dungeon.


______________________________________________________________________________
-------------------------------------------------------------- Warrior (3.2) -

Warriors could care less about spells, but are unmatched in brute fighting
ability.  Being the quickest to learn how to Critically hit their opponent,
they are very good fighters and alone can use the best weapons found in the
dungeon.


______________________________________________________________________________
-------------------------------------------------------------- Paladin (3.3) -

Paladins think of themselves as the heroes of the dungeon, blundering about
killing monsters and somewhat successfully healing themselves.  Possessing good
fighting skills and the ability to critically hit their enemies (though not
nearly at the level of a Warrior), one doesn’t have to be too smart to be a
Paladin, they just have to look good doing it.


______________________________________________________________________________
---------------------------------------------------------------- Ninja (3.4) -

Ninjas are weapons masters and can use almost all weapons including their
hands.  Since a Ninja desires quickness, they are very specific about the items
they use.  Ninjas are not allowed to wear most types of armor and other items.
However, having access to special weapons that only they can use, Ninjas posses
the skills of Critically hitting and Backstabbing their opponents, along with
moderate thieving skills.


______________________________________________________________________________
-------------------------------------------------------------- Villain (3.5) -

Villains are fallen Thieves, having strayed from the magical and equipment
restrictions of the Thief’s guild and gone their own way.  While working on
various poisons, the Villains learned or stole some of the secrets of healing.
They also have the ability to Critically hit and Backstab their opponents and
aren’t bad at collecting treasure.


______________________________________________________________________________
--------------------------------------------------------------- Seeker (3.6) -

Seekers are very good at moving through the dungeon, being able to levitate,
locate other characters, and teleport.  They can’t directly kill monsters with
their magical abilities, but a Seeker does well with a weapon in hand.  They
are also the best at mapping the dungeon and detecting any types of ‘anomalies’
they may encounter in the depths.


______________________________________________________________________________
---------------------------------------------------------------- Thief (3.7) -

Thieves are the best at collecting treasure, although the guild makes sure to
get a fair share.  Very devoted to stealing, Thieves often lack fighting skill,
but make up for it with their treacherous backstabbing.  Thieves also have the
best magical ability to open any type of sealed or locked container.


______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------ Scavenger (3.8) -

A Scavenger is a cross between a Warrior and a Thief, fighting a little worse
than the former and stealing a little worse than the latter.  A Scavenger can
backstab like a Thief, can be other than neutrally aligned, and can use a few
more items than a Thief  They are also fairly good at collecting treasure and
have access to some of the Thief’s magical spells for opening containers.


______________________________________________________________________________
----------------------------------------------------------------- Mage (3.9) -

Though they lack the destructive powers of a Sorcerer, Mages makes up for it by
having the ability to control powerful monsters to act as companions.  They are
also fairly adept at killing monsters with a small blade and curing players,
though putting a corpse back together is beyond their abilities.


______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------ Sorcerer (3.10) -

A Sorcerer lacks the fine mental control and deep concentration of a Mage while
in combat, and therefore, their spells tend to blast monsters against the walls
instead of charming them.  Outside of combat, a Sorcerer can muster up some
useful player protection spells, but lacks access to any types of healing
spells.


______________________________________________________________________________
-------------------------------------------------------------- Wizard (3.11) -

Wizards are very good at teleporting parties around the dungeon, although they
cannot always tell where they are going to land.  They also have damage spells
equivalent to a Healer and protection spells on par with a Sorcerer.


______________________________________________________________________________
-------------------------------------------------------------- Healer (3.12) -

Healers are very good at putting characters and companions back together again
after a rough day in the dungeon.  The best at curing, they are also fairly
good at killing monsters with a wide variety of damage spells.  Healers are
valued members of any party since they can fix almost any physical problem,
including death.

|                                  Spells (4.0)                              |
o============================================================================o

______________________________________________________________________________
---------------------------------------------------------- Fire Spells (4.1) -


Fire was the first of the elements sought to be controlled by the Sorcerers
guild.  Spells of this class inflict damage with heat, which can range from
a burning candle to a fiery inferno.  The effectiveness of these spells
depends on the experience of the caster and the Fire Resistance of the victim.


Firebolt

      Required Stats: 12 Int, 9 Wis
      COMBAT Spell, will cause 4 Monsters in 2 Groups to be Fried.
      This simplest of Fire Spells creates a small fireball and hurls it into a
      group of monsters, burning anything that gets in its way.

       
Blue Flame
      Base Level: 4      Guilds: Sor
      Required Stats: 14 Int, 10 Wis
      COMBAT Spell, will cause 2 Monsters in 1 Group to be Fried.
      A more advanced spell of flame, when invoked, the caster is able to hurl
      a blue colored magical flame at a group of monsters, inflicting extensive
      damage.


Flamesheet
      Base Level: 5      Guilds: Sor
      Required Stats: 15 Int, 14 Wis
      COMBAT Spell, will cause 6 Monsters in 3 Groups to be Fried.
      Derived from the Firebolt spell, this spell will summon a wall of fire
      and hurl towards ones opponents, usually causing the targets to be burnt
      to cinders.
        

Pillar of Fire
      Base Level: 7      Guilds: Sor
      Required Stats: 18 Int, 18 Wis, 16 Dex
      COMBAT Spell, will cause 7 Monsters in 4 Groups to be Fried.
      When invoked, this spell creates a devastating pillar of fire that forms
      directly in the middle of one's opponents and arcs outwards, enveloping
      all who are caught in the flames.


Sphere of Flames
      Base Level: 10      Guilds: Sor
      Required Stats: 20 Int, 21 Wis, 18 Dex
      COMBAT Spell, will cause 10 Monsters in 4 Groups to be Immolated.
      This spell creates a gigantic sphere of fire and hurls it into the midst
      of ones opponents.  Once the sphere contacts living matter, it explodes
      in an immolating blast of fury.


Burning Air      
      Base Level: 12      Guilds: Sor
      Required Stats: 21 Int, 21 Wis, 18 Dex 
      COMBAT Spell, will cause 14 Monsters in 4 Groups to be Immolated.
      The deadliest Fire spell of all, this hideous magic will cause the air to
      instantly turn white hot around one’s opponents, killing  almost anything
      that moves.


______________________________________________________________________________
---------------------------------------------------------- Cold Spells (4.2) -


After mastering Fire, the Sorcerers guild sought to prevent rivals from having
an equaling force and quickly moved to master the element of coldness so that
both Fire and Cold were controlled by one group. The effectiveness of these
spells depends on the experience of the caster and the Cold Resistance of the
target.


Cold Blast      
      Base Level: 2      Guilds: Sor
      Required Stats: 12 Int, 9 Wis, 9 Dex 
      COMBAT Spell, will cause 4 Monsters in 2 Groups to be Frozen. 
      This simple spell creates a blast of air that is cold enough to kill most
      small creatures.

      Required Stats: 16 Int, 8 Wis, 9 Dex
      COMBAT Spell, will cause 6 Monsters in 3 Groups to be Frozen.
      This spell creates a wall of ice and blasts it towards the opponents.
      The wave of liquid ice will almost certainly freeze the victim instantly.


Hail Storm      
      Base Level: 8      Guilds: Sor
      Required Stats: 19 Int, 18 Wis, 12 Dex
      COMBAT Spell, will cause 8 Monsters in 4 Groups to be Frozen.
      A more advanced spell, casting this will create a storm of magical hail

      collection of all other cold spells, and is so intense that very few can
      survive.

----------------------------------------------------- Electrical Spells (4.3) -


After discovering the destructive force of this element, the Sorcerer Masters
went to work on controlling this strange element that they didn’t understand.
For decades, they worked to make spells of this class controllable, and in the
end succeeded.  The effectiveness of these spells depends on the experience of
the caster and the Electrical Resistance of the target.

      withstand the shock delivered from this white-hot field of electricity.


______________________________________________________________________________
---------------------------------------------------------- Mind Spells (4.4) -


As the Sorcerers were working on destructive elemental forces, two other
guilds, the Mage and Wizards guilds, joined together in the study of the mind,
and in the process, came up with many powerful defensive and aggressive spells.

the Mind Resistance of the monster.

      the targets that they have died, causing their bodily functions to stop -
      effectively killing them from inside.


______________________________________________________________________________
-------------------------------------------------------- Damage Spells (4.5) -


The creation of these spells came about by accident as one Healer realized that
their healing magic could be turned to inflict harm.  Spells of this type are
excellent combative/defensive spells that can instantly kill victims just as
easily as the originals can be used to heal.  The effectiveness of these spells

target.

      and asks him to dispose of the caster’s targets.  When summoned in full,
      it is said that Nardun can never be overcome.


______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------- Element Spells (4.6) -


In the Sorcerer’s continued study of destruction, which included the study of

______________________________________________________________________________
---------------------------------------------------------- Kill Spells (4.7) -


Created in a parallel study by the Mages and Wizards guilds as they crafted the
Mind spells; the Kill spells, which revolved around direct mental and spiritual
forms of attack, would either kill the victim outright or have absolutely no
affect.  The effectiveness of these spells depends on the experience of the
caster and the Magic Resistance of the target.

controlling certain types of creatures ranging from Humanoids to Dragons and

______________________________________________________________________________
---------------------------------------------------------- Bind Spells (4.9) -


Once the Charm spells were mastered, the Mages guild then realized that once a
creature had been befriending or dominated that a way to keep the creature
under control was required.  It was for this reason that the Bind class of
spells was introduced - to reinforce a companions ‘binding’ to make it harder
for them to break away from their master.  Bind spells will not work on
companions that have joined an adventurer free of will.

      master Mage, almost no creature can resist it.


______________________________________________________________________________
--------------------------------------------------------- Heal Spells (4.10) -


The first of all spell classes to exist, the Healers guild built the foundation
for spells that had the ability to heal, take away disease, poisons and other

----------------------------------------------------- Movement Spells (4.11) -


In an effort to control one’s surroundings, the Wizard’s guild focused their
study towards the ability of traveling and moving by the use of magic.  Ranging
from the ability to walk through walls to teleporting a long distance away,
these spells are very handy in moving around in the dungeon.


Detect Rock      
      Base Level: 1      Guilds: See, Mag, Wiz
      Required Stats: 14 Int, 14 Wis, 12 Con      
      NON-COMBAT Spell, will inform caster of Rock.
      This spell allows the caster to detect whether rock exists behind the
      wall in front of them or not.  Very useful for mapping and finding secret
      rooms.
        

Feather Essence      
      Base Level: 3      Guilds: See, Mag, Wiz
      Required Stats: 14 Int, 14 Wis, 14 Con      
      NON-COMBAT Spell, will levitate recipient.
      This will cause the recipient to hover in the air, avoiding pits, chutes,
      water and other dangerous areas.  There is always the slight chance that
      levitation over a space  will fail.


Ethereal Portal
      Base Level: 5      Guilds: See, Mag, Wiz
      Required Stats: 14 Str, 18 Int, 18 Wis, 18 Dex      
      NON-COMBAT Spell, will move a character or party.
      When cast, the character, and all members of the party, will move through
      the solid wall in front of the caster and appear on the other side.  If
      the square behind the wall is rock, all members of the party will die.
      
  
Displacement
      Base Level: 8      Guilds: See, Wiz
      Required Stats: 14 Int, 10 Wis, 14 Dex      
      NON-COMBAT Spell, will teleport a character or party on the same level.
      A useful spell for teleporting around in the dungeon on the current
      level.  Be warned that if the caster teleports outside the bounds of the
      dungeon or into rock, the caster (and entire party) will die.
      
  
Mass Levitate
      Base Level: 8      Guilds: See, Wiz
      Required Stats: 12 Str, 16 Int, 16 Wis, 14 Con, 12 Dex      
      NON-COMBAT Spell, will Levitate entire party.
      This spell accomplishes the same as Feather Essence, except it affects an
      entire party.
      
  
Teleport
      Base Level: 12      Guilds: See, Wiz
      Required Stats: 17 Int, 14 Wis, 11 Con, 17 Dex      
      COMBAT & NON-COMBAT Spell, will cause 4 Monsters in 4 Groups to be
      Teleported or will teleport a character and their party
      One of the Seeker’s and Wizard’s most useful spells that can move the
      caster and any party up or down and around the dungeon a maximum of three
      levels.  This spell can also be used in Combat to transport attacking
      enemies so far away they they are impaled in solid rock!  When used in
      combat, the effectiveness of this spell is based on the creatures magical
      resistance.


Sanctuary

      Required Stats: 16 Int, 20 Wis, 15 Con

      location.  When invoked, this spell will instantly transport the caster
      and any party members to the location that ‘Set Sanctuary’ was cast last.
      If ‘Set Sanctuary’ has not been cast, nothing will happen.  Be warned
      that throwing this spell takes great energy and ages the caster 
      approximately one year.


______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------- Banish Spells (4.12) -


Taken from the art of demonology, spells of this kind are of ancient magic, of
which little is known.  Used to banish demons and devils back to the planes of
Hell from whence they came, the amount of damage inflicted by these spells can
sometimes be extensive.  The effectiveness of these spells depends on the
caster’s experience and the Magic Resistance of the monster.


Banish Devil      
      Base Level: 5      Guilds: Wiz (10), Hea
      Required Stats: 13 Int, 15 Wis, 10 Con      
      COMBAT Spell, will cause 8 Monsters in 4 Groups to be Banished.      
      An ancient spell that invokes the fury of Hell to yank the specified
      target(s) back to the plane from whence they came. 
 

Banish Demon      
      Base Level: 6      Guilds: Wiz (12), Hea
      Required Stats: 12 Int, 14 Wis, 10 Con      
      COMBAT Spell, will cause 8 Monsters in 4 Groups to be Banished.      
      A dark spell of old, much like Banish Devil, this spell calls upon Hades
      to take back those who have escaped.


______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------ Dispell Spells (4.13) -


These types of spells were actually created in the beginning by the Healer’s
guild to banish any poor soul that a resurrect failed upon, turning the victim
into the walking dead.  Now since the Resurrect spells have been mastered and
no longer produce these results, the study of this class turned towards
defending one’s self from any undead creatures that posed a threat.  The
effectiveness of these spells depends on the casters experience and the
Magic Resistance of the monster.


Dispel Undead      
      Base Level: 3      Guilds: Wiz, Hea
      Required Stats: 9 Int, 12 Wis, 6 Con      
      COMBAT Spell, will cause 8 Monsters in 4 Groups to be Dispelled.      
      A useful spell when attacked by undead, any targets affected by this
      spell will instantly break down and become dust. 
 

Dispel Elemental      
      Base Level: 4      Guilds: Wiz, Hea
      Required Stats: 15 Int, 15 Wis, 15 Con, 17 Cha      
      COMBAT Spell, will cause 8 Monsters in 4 Groups to be Dispelled.      
      Even though the true nature of most Elemental creatures is unknown, this
      spell is said to act much like Dispel Undead whereas it breaks apart the
      Elemental targets and turns them to back into the elements from which
      they were formed.       


Abolish Undead      
      Base Level: 8      Guilds: Wiz, Hea
      Required Stats: 16 Int, 18 Wis, 18 Con, 12 Dex      
      COMBAT Spell, will cause 4 Monsters in 2 Groups to be Dispelled.      
      The most advanced Dispell spell ever devised, the magic induced when
      invoked is so great that it usually annihilates all targets.  The only
      drawback is that the magic is usually too focused to affect a large
      number of targets.


______________________________________________________________________________
---------------------------------------------------- Resistant Spells (4.14) -


Initially created by the Sorcerers guild to protect themselves from their own
destructive forces, these spells are very useful in increasing the resistance
of a character from many forms of attack.  The Healers guild also helped in
this study and created spells to increase ones resistance to Poison and
Disease.

      Resist Magic      
      Base Level: 5      Guilds: See (15), Sor, Wiz (15), Hea (10)
      Required Stats: 14 Int, 12 Wis, 12 Con, 12 Cha      
      NON-COMBAT Spell, will raise the recipient’s Magic Resistance to 95%.


      Mental Resistance      
      Base Level: 6      Guilds: Sor, Wiz (18)
      Required Stats: 18 Int, 14 Wis, 12 Con, 10 Cha      
      NON-COMBAT Spell, will raise the recipient’s Mental Resistance to 95%.
              

      Electrical Resistance      
      Base Level: 6      Guilds: Sor, Wiz (18)
      Required Stats: 12 Str, 12 Int, 16 Wis, 12 Con      
      NON-COMBAT Spell, will raise the recipient’s Electrical Resistance to
      95%.
              

      Resist Acidity      
      Base Level: 6      Guilds: Sor, Wiz (18)
      Required Stats: 10 Str, 13 Int, 10 Wis, 15 Con      
      NON-COMBAT Spell, will raise the recipient’s Acidity Resistance to 95%.
      
      
______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------- Visual Spells (4.15) -


In a collected effort, the Sorcerer’s and Wizard’s guilds managed to create
spells that allowed one to turn invisible to the naked eye, and allowed one to
see those who were invisible as well.


Sight Veil      
      Base Level: 2      Guilds: See (6), Mag (4), Sor, Wiz (8)
      Required Stats: 12 Int, 12 Wis, 12 Cha      
      NON-COMBAT Spell, will cause the receiving character to become Invisible.
      This spell is very useful defensive spell.  When cast the recipient
      becomes invisible to the naked eye, only those with special abilities
      will be able to see the character.

      Base Level: 2      Guilds: See (6), Mag (4), Sor, Wiz (8)

      NON-COMBAT Spell, will cause the entire party to become Invisible.
      This spell is the same as Sight Veil except that it affects the entire
      party.


______________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------ Magical Spells (4.16) -


Spells of this nature vary depending on type.  Being purely magical and created
by various guilds, spells of this type usually revolve around some effect that
is not supported by any of the other classes.


Charm of Opening      
      Base Level: 1      Guilds: Nom (12), Nin (9), Thi(3), Sca (6)
      Required Stats: 12 Str, 13 Int, 13 Wis, 13 Dex

      Casting this spell will unlock a magically locked chest.


______________________________________________________________________________
----------------------------------------------------- Location Spells (4.17) -

caster in  orientation when  lost.

      NON-COMBAT Spell, will seek out and return the location of another
      character.  This spell allows the caster to search for another character.
      The caster will receive the offset coordinates, relative to the spell

      For the times that an unlucky character teleports or walks into solid
      rock, the only way to retrieve them is with this spell.  The caster of
      the spell must be on the same level that the Rocked character is, or as
      close as they can get.  If the spell is successful, the retrieved
      character’s body will appear at the feet of the caster ready to be
      carried or resurrected.


______________________________________________________________________________
--------------------------------------------------- Protection Spells (4.18) -


Created by the Sorcerer’s guild, spells of this type cause the caster, or
character receiving the spell, to be protected by an invisible field.  The

|                                  Glitches                                  |
o============================================================================o


Slaves - Charm a slave, then take it to Confinement.  Simply keep realigning it
         from Good to Evil and back again until you have the desired amount of
         money.

Item Exhange - Create a new character.  Load this character but don't click Run
               yet.  Go to the Exchange Items in the main menu.  Select the
               person you want to have the money.  Click on your real
               character's money and drag it to your new character.  A box will
               come up.  Type in a negative number.  Your real character just
               received that amount!

Healer Glitch - Theoretically, you're supposed to be casting all spells at the
by:             spell level of the guild in which you learnt that particular
A. J. Raffles   spell, not the one you have currently selected. For example if
                you are a level 100 Healer, you'll be casting Word of Death at
                spell level 50, even if you are currently leveling Warrior and
                have reached level 500 there. Healing spells are different. That
                level 100 Healer/level 500 Warrior would cast a healing spell
                like Restoration at level 50 while he was leveling in Healer,
                but at level 250 while he was leveling in Warrior.

Quest Master - Occasionally the Questmaster will tell you to bring back an item.
               Not so hard, right?  Right.  But, the Questmaster is a Con man!
               When you level up you need to pay a fee to the guild.  When you
               level up the Questmaster will check that you have the right
               amount of experience, then that you have the item you were on the
               quest for, takes the item, checks for the gold, then takes said
               gold.  The glitch is, if you have the item but not the gold, the
               Questmaster will take the item but you will not level up.  You
               will then have to get the item and gold before you can level up.
