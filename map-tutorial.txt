For each tile (represented as an object in the tiles array or a cell in the grid):

    x (integer): The horizontal coordinate of the tile.

    y (integer): The vertical coordinate of the tile.

    type (string): The base type of the tile. This links to your sprite sheet. Examples:

        "floor"

        "wall" (for solid blocks like the black areas)

        "water" (for blue wavy areas)

        "door_closed"

        "door_open"

        "stair_down"

        "stair_up"

        "trap"

        "chest"

        "lever"

        "pit"

        "special_area_1" (for the patterned areas)

    sprite_id (string/integer, optional): If your type isn't enough to determine the exact sprite, you might have a specific ID. E.g., type: "floor", sprite_id: "rough_stone".

    walls (object): Defines which sides of the tile have a wall. This is crucial for movement and line of sight.
    JSON

"walls": {
  "north": true,
  "east": false,
  "south": true,
  "west": false
}

    true means there's a wall. false means it's open.

    You could also use 0/1 for boolean or omit false entries to save space.

exits (array of objects): Defines special transitions from this tile. This is particularly important for doors, stairs, or portals.
JSON

"exits": [
  {
    "direction": "south", // Direction from this tile
    "type": "door",       // e.g., "door", "stairs", "teleporter"
    "state": "closed",    // For doors: "open", "closed", "locked"
    "target_map": "Mordor Depth of Dejenol Level 2", // Name of target map file
    "target_x": 10,       // X coordinate in the target map
    "target_y": 15,       // Y coordinate in the target map
    "key_id": "iron_key_1" // For locked doors
  },
  {
    "direction": "west",
    "type": "teleporter",
    "target_map": "self", // Means staying on the current map
    "target_x": 5,
    "target_y": 5
  }
]

    direction can be north, east, south, west, or even any for a general portal.

contents (array of strings or objects, optional): What items, monsters, or interactive elements are on this tile.
JSON

"contents": [
  "monster_orc_grunt",
  "item_gold_pile",
  "object_pressure_plate_trap"
]

properties (object, optional): Any other miscellaneous properties for the tile.

    "damage_type": "fire"

    "effect": "poisonous_gas"

    "light_source": true

    "description": "A crumbling stone slab."

events (array of objects, optional): Triggers or scripts associated with entering or interacting with the tile.
JSON

    "events": [
      {"trigger": "on_enter", "action": "spawn_monster", "monster_type": "goblin"},
      {"trigger": "on_interact", "action": "open_door", "door_id": "door_123"}
    ]

Example Tile for your map (e.g., the white square at 10,10):

If we look at a simple white square in your map, say at x=10, y=10 (assuming 0-indexed from bottom left):
JSON

{
  "x": 10,
  "y": 10,
  "type": "floor",
  "walls": {
    "north": false,
    "east": false,
    "south": false,
    "west": false
  },
  "exits": [],
  "contents": []
}

Now consider a wall-like tile (black area) to its right, at x=11, y=10:
JSON

{
  "x": 11,
  "y": 10,
  "type": "unpassable_wall", // Or just "wall"
  "walls": {
    "north": true,
    "east": true,
    "south": true,
    "west": true
  },
  "exits": [],
  "contents": []
}

And one of the patterned tiles, like at x=2, y=28:
JSON

{
  "x": 2,
  "y": 28,
  "type": "decorative_floor_pattern_1", // Or a specific sprite_id
  "walls": {
    "north": false,
    "east": false,
    "south": false,
    "west": false
  },
  "exits": [],
  "contents": []
}

  ]
}

Considerations for Implementation

    Sprite Mapping: Your game engine would read the type (and possibly sprite_id) from each tile object and use it to look up the correct sprite from your generated sprite sheet.

    Wall Rendering: Walls are often rendered separately from the floor tile. The walls attribute tells you whether to draw a wall segment on a specific side of the tile. This is important for "L" shaped walls, "T" intersections, etc., where the floor might be the same type, but the surrounding walls change.

    Pathfinding: This data structure provides all the information needed for pathfinding algorithms (like A*). You can easily determine if a tile is walkable and what its neighbors are.

    Editor Tools: For larger maps, you'd likely want a map editor that exports to this JSON format, rather than hand-editing the JSON.

    Coordinate System: Be consistent! Decide if (0,0) is top-left or bottom-left, and how x and y increase (e.g., x right, y up for Cartesian; or x right, y down for screen coordinates). Your example map appears to have x increasing right and y increasing up, starting from (2,2) as the lowest corner.

By using a structure like this, you can fully describe your map and all its interactive elements in a way that's easy for a game to load and process.
