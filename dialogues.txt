An Analysis of Dialogue and Narrative Structures in Mordor: Depths of Dejenol

1.0. Introduction: Redefining "Dialogue" in the Labyrinth

Mordor: Depths of Dejenol, a 1995 dungeon crawler developed by David Allen, is a game that is often misunderstood when analyzed through the lens of modern role-playing game conventions. As a product of its time, it draws its primary influence not from cinematic, story-driven RPGs, but from earlier, text-based multi-user dungeon (MUD) games like Avatar. This lineage prioritizes systemic depth, exploration, and punishing resource management over a traditional authored narrative. The game's success is predicated on its complex mechanics, which challenge the player to optimize their characters and navigate a sprawling, 15-level dungeon.  

The central challenge of analyzing the "dialogue" of Mordor is that the game lacks a conventional, scripted plot or puzzles in its original form. A reviewer for  

Next Generation condemned the game for its "lack of story and puzzles," noting that this absence made it "just not fun". Yet, other testimonials describe the game as an "addicting" "grind fest" that "just burns hours of your life" without a plot or point. This contradiction necessitates a radical re-evaluation of what constitutes "dialogue" and "narrative" within this specific context. In  

Mordor, these elements are not presented through interactive conversational choices but are revealed to be structural, functional, and, most importantly, emergent. The game is a masterclass in minimalist ludonarrative design, where the player's actions, and the community's response to those actions, are the story.

This report will deconstruct the game's minimalist internal communications, expose the rich, external, and community-driven narrative it engenders, and clearly distinguish its design philosophy from that of a modern fan-made mod. The analysis will demonstrate that the game's apparent narrative void is not a flaw, but a deliberate design choice that forces the player into the role of narrator, creating a uniquely personal and communal experience.

2.0. Section I: The Utilitarian Voice - Dialogue as Functional System

The most apparent form of "dialogue" within Mordor: Depths of Dejenol is not designed for storytelling but for the transmission of system-level instructions and transactional information. These communications are sparse and serve a purely utilitarian purpose, guiding the player through the game's mechanics rather than its lore.

2.1. Scripted Prompts and Environmental Text

The game's most basic textual exchanges are one-way transmissions of information from the dungeon to the player. The original version of Mordor contained a single riddle that "didn't actually do anything". This type of communication functioned as pure flavor text, adding a hint of mystique without serving a mechanical purpose. In stark contrast, a popular fan-made mod for  

Legend of Grimrock, which uses the Mordor name and dungeon layouts, introduces "functional, riddles" that are crucial to quest progression. For example, a riddle like "A potion to counteract the aboleth's spit. Bring the child of slime and tar for a reward!" provides a specific puzzle-solving task, directing the player to find and place the correct potion in an alcove to complete the quest. This distinction highlights a fundamental difference between the original game and its fan-made counterpart: the mod transforms non-functional, ambient text into a critical game mechanism.  

2.2. Functional 'Conversations' in the City

The city hub in Mordor is a prime example of dialogue reduced to its most functional form. Locations such as the General Store, the Morgue, and the Guilds are described not as social spaces but as transactional interfaces. A player's "dialogue" with these establishments is a series of commands and responses devoid of conversational nuance. The game's manual-like description of the city's features reinforces this: the Morgue is a "Place to revive your characters," the Guild is where you "level up" and "join other guilds," and the General Store is where you "buy items" or "sell items".  

This minimalist approach to NPC interaction is a core tenet of the game's design. The NPCs are not characters with personalities, backstories, or opinions; they are purely functional interfaces that facilitate the player's progression through the game's systems. The player's relationship with a shopkeeper is not one of friendly banter or moral negotiation, but a purely economic one. By removing non-essential narrative friction, this model focuses the player's attention entirely on the core gameplay loop of dungeon exploration and resource management. This design demonstrates that a game can possess a robust and addictive progression structure without relying on traditional narrative padding. The game’s communications, both on-screen and in its documentation, function as a user manual, not as a story script.  

2.3. Player-Initiated Communication

The few instances of player-to-NPC interaction that resemble dialogue are entirely mechanical. The game's combat system is a "semi-automatic RTwP" experience. While players cannot engage in conversation with monsters, they can use spells like "charm" to acquire a companion. This is not a conversational interaction but a combat outcome that leads to a transactional relationship. The acquired monster can then be "sold" for profit in the city's Confinement area, a functional equivalent to the General Store for enslaved creatures. This mechanism further underscores the game's focus on a utilitarian, systemic model of interaction.  

The following table summarizes the various forms of "dialogue" present in the game and its community, highlighting the distinction between in-game functionality and external player-driven narrative.
Dialogue Type	Source	Function	Example
Environmental Text (Riddle)	In-Game (Wall Text)	Puzzle-solving	

"Bring the child of slime and tar for a reward!"  

Transactional ('Conversation')	In-Game (City Interface)	System interaction	

"Morgue: Place to revive your characters."  

Spell-Based Interaction	In-Game (Player Spell)	Gameplay utility	

Charming a monster to acquire a companion.  

Player-Generated Narrative	External (Reddit/Forum)	Narrative expression	

Yesma's backstory as a "Tome hunter, route mapper, body rescuer."  

Community-Driven Dialogue	External (Reddit/Forum)	Community building

3.0. Section II: The Player's Voice - The Emergent Narrative Engine

The true "dialogue" and "relationships" of Mordor: Depths of Dejenol are not found within the game's executable files but are created and shared by the players themselves. The game's minimalist design creates a narrative vacuum that serves as a powerful creative catalyst for its community.

3.1. The Narrative Vacuum as a Creative Catalyst

The original game's lack of an authored plot or central story  does not result in an absence of narrative. Instead, it fosters an  

emergent narrative. The game provides a deep, complex, and punishing mechanical framework, complete with multiple races, alignments, and guilds such as Warrior, Sorcerer, Thief, and Healer. This framework serves as a scaffold upon which players construct their own stories and character dynamics. Testimonials from the player community consistently describe creating detailed backstories and complex interpersonal relationships for their party members. The game's grind-heavy nature and punishing difficulty become the setting for a "constant thought experiment" in which the player’s survival and progression are the central, unwritten plot. The struggle for survival itself, rather than a scripted sequence of events, becomes the primary engine of the story.  

3.2. Case Studies in Player-Generated Relationships

The depth of the game's systems is directly responsible for the richness of the emergent narrative. Player discussions reveal an intricate, multi-classing system where characters can join various guilds, but at the cost of "huge XP requirements" and "severe penalties" for unbalanced progression. An optimal path, known as the "Warrior-Nomad-Wizard (WNW) leveling route," requires players to navigate this complexity to maximize hit points and capabilities. These intricate and often frustrating mechanical realities demand a narrative explanation. The player, lacking an in-game script, invents one.  

This causal link between systemic depth and emergent narrative is a defining feature of the Mordor experience. The mechanical choices the player makes become the basis for their party’s backstory and relationships. Consider the following examples:

    Yesma: This character is not an NPC but a player-created "Tome hunter, route mapper, body rescuer, and emergency evac". The player's desire for an efficient character to retrieve dead companions and map the dungeon is translated into the narrative of an "ancient being" who "disrespects the topology" of the labyrinth to aid others. The mechanical purpose becomes a narrative truth.   

Pip: A character described as "the murder orphan" who is a "dangerous miscreant" and is "known for stabbing first and asking questions later". This backstory is a justification for her mechanical role as a Thief/Seeker, a character archetype optimized for backstab damage and thieving skills. The player invents a tragic, violent past to rationalize her combat role and skills.  

Ming the Mighty: This character is a Sorcerer, driven by the goal of becoming an "evil mastermind in training". The player's decision to level Ming as a spellcaster is given narrative weight by framing his in-game actions—avoiding direct combat and relying on his party—as an expression of his vile, power-hungry nature.  

Lady De'neisha: The Elven Healer is described as being a part of Ming's crew because "rumour is that Ming has just enough dirt on her to keep her in the crew". This is a player-created narrative to explain a common game phenomenon: why a healer, essential for party survival, would stay with a group of "misfits". The mechanical necessity of having a healer is given a complex interpersonal dimension by the player.  

The following table further illustrates the richness of these player-created narratives, which contrast sharply with the original game's lack of internal story.
Character	Role/Class	Player-Written Description
Yesma	Neutral Osiri Seeker/Thief/Warrior	

A "dungeon parkourist" and "body rescuer" who "disrespects the topology" of the dungeon to retrieve lost comrades and loot.  

Janus Stoneblood	Neutral Dwarf Warrior/Scavenger	

The gruff and proud leader of the "Business Team," a "sack of hit points and armour" who is prone to getting lost.  

Pip	Evil Human Thief/Seeker	

A "murder orphan" and "dangerous miscreant" known for stabbing first, with her backstory justifying her high backstab damage and thieving skill.  

Ming the Mighty	Evil Human Sorcerer	

An "evil mastermind in training" who has hired a crew to keep him out of danger while he seeks arcane power.  

Lady De'neisha	Neutral Elf Healer	

An elven noble who tolerates the party's antics, with a rumor suggesting Ming has compromising information on her to ensure she stays with the crew.  

3.3. The Social Structure of Dialogue

The community is the primary repository for this emergent narrative. The bulk of the available information comes from forum posts, comments, and community wikis. This confirms that the game's "dialogue" is not a private experience but a social one. Players share their character builds, lament their failures, and celebrate their successes in a communal space. This communal dialogue, filled with anecdotes and shared struggles, provides the lore and narrative that the game itself omits. The game's dialogue, therefore, exists as much on Reddit and community forums as it does on the game screen.  

4.0. Section III: A Tale of Two Mordors - Original vs. The LoG Mod

A crucial aspect of this analysis is the clear distinction between the original 1995 game and a fan-made mod for Legend of Grimrock. The mod, referred to as a "LoG-ification" of Mordor, is a distinct entity where "Only the name and the dungeon layouts (and some monster names) have been retained - everything else has been changed".  

4.1. A New Approach to Dialogue

The Legend of Grimrock mod's design philosophy fundamentally reintroduces a more traditional dialogue structure that was intentionally absent from the original. The mod features a structured quest system with "12 quests per class". It also adds content like "Ranger dungeons" that "will introduce more story and more challenges". As previously mentioned, the riddles in the mod are no longer just flavor text; they are "functional," requiring specific item combinations and providing a clear narrative purpose to the player's actions.  

This shift demonstrates a move from an emergent, grind-based game to a more structured, modern RPG. The mod adds a layer of authored dialogue and narrative purpose that was a deliberate design omission in the original. To misrepresent the mod's features as belonging to the original game would be a critical failure in analysis. The contrast highlights the different eras of game design and the evolution of player expectations regarding narrative and character interaction. The original Mordor is a product of an era where a game's systems were the primary focus, while the mod reflects a contemporary sensibility that values authored content and linear progression.

The following table provides a clear delineation of the differences between the original game and its modern mod, illustrating their distinct approaches to narrative.
Feature	Original Game (1995)	Legend of Grimrock Mod
Core Narrative	

None; the game's story is confined to its documentation.  

	

Added mini-stories and Ranger dungeons.  

Quest System	

Minimal/Implied; progression is tied to descending to deeper levels.  
	

	

Structured, with "12 quests per class."  

NPC Interaction	

Transactional and purely functional.  
	

	

More interactive, with NPCs serving as quest-givers.  

Riddle/Puzzle Functionality	

Non-functional flavor text ("didn't actually do anything").  
	

	

Functional and required for quests.  

Player Agency	Uniquely high due to the narrative void, leading to emergent stories.	Still high, but constrained by authored quests and puzzles.

5.0. Conclusion: Mordor as a Case Study in Ludonarrative Minimalism

The structure of dialogue and its relationships in Mordor: Depths of Dejenol is not a simple, monolithic system but a multi-layered, paradoxical one. The game's internal voice is purely utilitarian, serving as a functional interface to its intricate mechanics. Conversely, its true narrative and character relationships are external, created and sustained by the player community.

This phenomenon offers a crucial lesson in game design. While the game was criticized by reviewers for its "lack of story and puzzles," which they claimed made it "just not fun" , players praised it as "addicting," providing "endless hours of fun". The very things the game was criticized for are precisely what allowed its core systems to shine. The "narrative void" is not a flaw; it is the deliberate space where the player's imagination and the game's mechanics fully intersect without conflict. The game’s intricate guild system and punishing progression force players to invent stories and character motivations to justify their mechanical choices and survive the labyrinth. The struggle for an optimal leveling path, a new weapon, or a rare potion becomes the plot.  

Mordor: Depths of Dejenol stands as a historical counter-example to the modern belief that all games require a grand, authored story. It demonstrates that a game can succeed by providing an engaging mechanical framework and trusting its players to create their own meaning and narrative. The "dialogue" of Mordor is a testament to the power of minimalist design and the creative capacity of the player community, making it a pivotal case study in the history of game design and the study of emergent narrative.
