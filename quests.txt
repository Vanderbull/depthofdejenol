Quests
Source: https://web.archive.org/web/20160804023425/...uesting_Formula

Quests are assigned based on the current guild level

Monster quests will appear from gLevel 5 onward
Item quests will appear from gLevel 15 onward, with a 25% frequency

There is always a 1% minimum chance of being assigned a quest (mods cannot change this)
There is a 6% chance of not being assigned a quest ("Questmaster lets you off the hook...")

Assigned monsters will be from mLevel=1 to [gLevel / 25], to a maximum of mLevel=10
Assigned items will be from iLevel=1 to ((gLevel / 25, rounded down, max 10) / 1.5) + 1, to a maximum of iLevel=7

"Rare Monsters" have a spawn weight of 9 or less. They are rerolled 74% of the time
"Rare Items" have a spawn weight of 4 or less. They are rerolled 74% of the time
Cursed items, items with iLevel=0, and items worth less than 100g will never be assigned

Due to a bug, there are 4 monsters from mLevel>10 that can be assigned as quests: T'Mana (11), White Dragons (11), Wizards (11), and Grey Molds (13)
Due to a bug, T'Mana cannot spawn (you should forfeit the quest as soon as possible)
