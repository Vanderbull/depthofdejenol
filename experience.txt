Experience from monsters
CODE
= floor[hits * (9 - ln(hits + 1)) * (20 - ln(hits)) * (mLvl + 50) * companionFactor * guildFactor / 1000] * partyFactor
companionFactor = 1.00 if you do the damage, or 0.25 if a companion does the damage
partyFactor = 1 - (partySize - 1) * 0.04
guildFactor = 1 / (1 + gLvl/333)

Experience from chests
CODE
= floor[disarmChance * mLvl * 0.50 * guildFactor]
See disarming chests above. Note that values here range from 5 to 98
