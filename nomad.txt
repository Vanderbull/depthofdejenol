Hits

When gaining a nomad level, if the new nomad level is a character's single highest guild level and is 30 or below, the character gains 5 hits, plus a random bonus for high constitution. If the new nomad level is a character's single highest guild level and is 31 or above, the character gains 1 hit, with no constitution bonus. If the new nomad level is tied with or lower than any of the character's other guild levels, the character gains no hits.
