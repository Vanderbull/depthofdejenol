C++ Build & Development Guide

This project uses qmake for build configuration and Bear to generate the compilation database required for LSP-based editors (like Micro, VS Code, or Neovim).
1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the necessary build tools installed on your system (Debian/Ubuntu):
Bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential qt6-base-dev bear

2. Initial Setup & Compilation

To build the project for the first time, follow these steps:

    Generate the Makefile:
    Bash

qmake6 project.pro

Build and Generate LSP Metadata: We use bear to intercept the build process and create compile_commands.json. This enables "IntelliSense" features (Autocomplete, Go-to-Definition) in your editor.
Bash

    bear -- make

3. Development Workflow
Adding New Files

If you add new .cpp or .h files to the .pro file, you must refresh the build scripts:
Bash

qmake6 project.pro
make clean
bear -- make

Daily Compiling

If you are only editing existing files, you can simply run:
Bash

make

Note: You only need to run bear again if you want to update the autocompletion database after adding new libraries or files.
4. Editor Integration (LSP)

This project is optimized for editors using clangd.

    Micro: Ensure the lsp plugin is installed. The compile_commands.json generated by Bear will be detected automatically.

    VS Code: Install the clangd extension. It will read the JSON file to provide accurate code analysis.

    Neovim: Use nvim-lspconfig with the clangd server.

5. Cleaning the Project

To remove all compiled objects and the metadata:
Bash

make clean
rm compile_commands.json

    Note for Contributors: Please do not commit compile_commands.json or Makefile to the repository. These are machine-specific files.
