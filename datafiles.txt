Data Files

Whenever using an editor, it is extremely important to backup data files to ensure they are not damaged beyond repair. If this precaution is not followed, a reinstall may be necessary. However, it is possible to reset some data simply by opening C:\MORDOR\DATA and deleting specific .mdr files.

This is also useful for a player who wishes to have a clean start in their Mordor game without having to delete and reinstall the program.
Expendable .mdr Files

If deleted, these files are recreated on a subsequent execution of Mordor.exe, and are not necessary for the program to run. Deleting any of these erases what they contains, returning the data to how it would've been upon the original startup of Mordor.

    mdata4.mdr: Character information
    mdata6.mdr: General Store contents
    mdata7.mdr: Current guildmasters
    mdata8.mdr: Automap data
    mdata9.mdr: Guild logs
    mdata10.mdr: Current condition of dungeon (ie, treasure chest locations, presence of monsters in certain rooms)
    mdata12.mdr: Existing parties
    mdata13.mdr: Library entries
    mdata14.mdr: Hall of records
    mdata15.mdr: Confinement creatures
